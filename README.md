# Genetic interaction datasets
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/theJasonFan/gi-data.svg?token=Xz9rMtpGH2yMytbU95xT&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/theJasonFan/gi-data)

Repo for parsing GI datasets. This repo is overengineered to make parsing verifiable and reproducable. Changes to parsed files should be caught by CI.

- `datasets` contains parsed datasets
- `GIData` contains GIData package that is used to standardize the parsing, loading, saving, of parsed GI studies
